# Note Taker

## Description

This project focused on using Express to link a front-end and back-end together. The front end was provided, and I constructed the back end to allow HTML routing and API calls. Notes are saved to a db.json file, and displayed on the screen to the user. The user can switch between different notes, a process that is managed by the api. 

## Usage

Click "Get Started", type your note, and click the save icon to save a note. Created notes will display on the left hand side of your screen, and you can click on them to view them.

## Installation
